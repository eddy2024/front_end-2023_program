    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <p>Penuel (or Pniel, Pnuel; Hebrew: פְּנוּאֵל‎ Pənūʾēl) is a place
     described in the Hebrew Bible as being not far from Succoth, on the 
     east of the Jordan River and south of the river Jabbok in present-day Jordan.

     Penuel is mentioned in the Book of Genesis as the site of
     Jacob's struggle with the angel. In 1 Kings, it is mentioned 
     as a capital for Jeroboam, first king of the northern Kingdom of Israel,
      which he fortified.</p>

    <h2 id="biblical">Biblical Narrative</h2>
    <p>According to the Biblical narrative, the site was named Peniel ("Face of God") by Jacob:

        It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.
        
        — Gen. 32:30 NIV
        Here Jacob wrestled (Gen. 32:24–32) "with a man" ("the angel", Hos. 12:4) "till the break of day."
        This episode resulted in God (or the angel) changing Jacob's name to "Israel" (Gen. 32:28) which literally means,
         "he who strives with God" or "God strives".[1]
        
        Penuel is later mentioned in the Book of Judges. The men of this place refused to give bread to Gideon
        and his three hundred men when they were in pursuit of the Midianites (Judges 8:1–21). On his return, 
        Gideon tore down the tower there and killed all the men of the city.
        
        According to the Jewish Bible, king Jeroboam of Israel established his capital in Shechem.
        A short time later, he left Shechem and fortified Penuel, declaring it as his new capital (1 Kings 12:25).
        He and his son, Nadab, ruled there, until Baasha seized the throne in 909 BCE and moved the capital to Tirzah 
        (1 Kings 15:25–34).[original research?] In the scriptures, it is identified as both an El-site and a Jahwist site.[2]
        
        ‘Pnuel’ is also a common name given to males in Assyrian culture.
        
        Some scholars consider that the material of Genesis 32–35, including the account of Jacob being renamed Israel at Penuel,
        may be a later addition that introduces a new power structure centered around the establishment of sacral places in the 
        North (Penuel, Shechem and Bethel).[3]</p>


    <h2 id="where_in_bible">Where is Penuel in the Bible?</h2>
    <p>Penuel (or Pniel, Pnuel; Hebrew: פְּנוּאֵל Pənūʾēl) is 
        a place described in the Hebrew Bible as being not 
        far from Succoth, on the east of the Jordan River and
        south of the river Jabbok in present-day Jordan .
        Penuel is mentioned in the Book of Genesis as the 
        site of Jacob's struggle with the angel.</p>


        <h2 id="penuel_mean">What does Peniel mean in the Bible?</h2>
        <p>Peniel (also spelled Penuel) means “fface of God.”
         In Genesis 32, Jacob is on his way to meet Esau and 
         is dreading the encounter, thinking that Esau is going
         to kill him. (Esau had vowed to do just that in 
         Genesis 27:41 because Jacob had cheated him out of 
         receiving his father’s blessing.)</p>

         <h2 id="arch_phanuel">Who is Archangel Phanuel?</h2>
         <p></p>Archangel Phanuel depicted in the Ethiopian scroll
          with the Lion of Judah. It contains prayers against evil
          which invoke the help of this archangel. Phanuel is the
          name given to the fourth angel who stands before God in 
          the Book of Enoch (ca. 300 BC), after the angels Michael,
          Raphael, and Gabriel.

        <h1>JUKES-EDWARDS - 
          A STUDY IN EDUCATION AND HEREDITY</h1>
          <p>It is nearly 170 years since then. Science and invention, enterprise and ambition have
             done great things for America and for Americans. We have mighty universities, libraries,
              and laboratories, but we have no man who thinks more clearly, writes more logically,
               speaks more vigorously than did Jonathan Edwards, and we have never had such a combination
                of spirit and power in any other American. This mastery is revealing itself in various
                 ways in hundreds of his descendants to-day, and it has never ceased to do it since his
                  blood gave tonic to the thought and character of his children and his children's children.</p>
