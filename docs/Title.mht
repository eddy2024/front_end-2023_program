invited to his home ten other Connecticut pastors of whom nine were graduat=

laying them upon Mr. Russell's table, said: &quot;I give these books for the
founding of a college in this colony.&quot; This produced a profound impres=

resided for ten years. In 1770 he returned to Stockbridge, Mass. Berkshire =

The store which Mr. Edwards opened in 1770 was the first in the county. The
settlers raised wheat on the newly cleared land. This Mr. Edwards bought and
sent to New York, bringing back goods in return. In five years he became the
most prosperous man in the county, buying and clearing a very large farm on
which he employed as many as fifty men in the busy season.<o:p></o:p></span=

lime vats and water pools to let off the contents into the brook. The bark =

ground by horse power. There was a curb fifteen feet in diameter, made of
three-inch plank, with a rim fifteen inches high. Within this was a stone w=

wheels which would grind half a cord of bark in a day of twelve hours. The
